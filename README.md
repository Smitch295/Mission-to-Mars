# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this challenge was to assist Robin in adding more features to her website. By using BeautifulSoup and Splinter we scraped full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images. Now Robin's website looks even better than it did before.
